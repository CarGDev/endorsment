# Documentation Autowriter

When to use this skill

- Use whenever you add new components, agents, or stores and want docs updated for reviewers.
- Triggered by prompts like "update README" or "generate architecture overview".

Instructions

1. First Step: Scan `src/components/` and `src/stores/` to build a component map and store summary.

2. Second Step: Render `README.md` with development steps, demo instructions (how to use Copilot CLI agents), and a brief feature summary.

3. Third Step: Produce `ARCHITECTURE.md` documenting Atomic Design layout, store relationships, and agent/skill list for the judges.

Examples

- README includes: setup, run, test, demo CLI steps (`gh copilot ask "Find endorsers for my paper"`).

Notes

- Keep automated docs human-editable and include pointers to extend the output (how to add a new component/module).
